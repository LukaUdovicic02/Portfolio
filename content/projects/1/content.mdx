## Introduction

A recent study by TouchBistro indicates a notable increase in the frequency of dining out,
with nearly half of consumers reporting eating at restaurants 2-4 times per week. The report
highlights the growing influence of social factors, such as recommendations from friends and
online reviews, on dining decisions. In particular, millennials appear to rely heavily on online
feedback, with 67% of respondents indicating that they consider reviews when selecting new
dining spots (Krook, 2023).

Users often rely on fragmented sources of information, such as online reviews,
recommendations from friends, or simply walking in without prior knowledge (Smith &
Johnson, 2021). This fragmented approach not only lacks convenience but also makes the
overall dining experience worse
Moreover, with the increasing tend of urbanization and globalization, people are frequently
traveling to different cities fr work or leisure. _By 2050 more than two-thirds of the world's
population is projected to be lving in urban areas_ (Palanivel, 2017).

This urban growth has been accopanied by a significant increase in inernational tourism,
with the number of internationa trips more than doubling since the strt of the millennium
(Bastian Herre and Veronika Samorska, 2023). In a new city, they ofte face the challenge
of finding suitable dining optins that match their preferences and ditary requirements. This
can be frustrating, especially hen unfamiliar with the local dining cisine (Travelavidly, 2024).

It's o secret that nowadays mot luxurious restaurants are using somekind of booking
syste, which can help clients et a reservation upfront and securely.A booking system
must e a reliable and easy-to-se system so that anyone can utilize i without the need for
extenive guidance. _Most moder restaurants work with reservation sofware. People can
easil view and book available ables online or via an app, and the't eed to call to
modify or cancel their reservaton. (Smaddalena, 2024).
Whether a guet is inspired by a
food ost on Instagram, explorig options on Googl
Maps,or browsing a restaurant' website, they can act on that impulseimmediately._
(Tablin Team, 2024)
In the restaurant business customer satisfaction is a priority, making it easier and enjoyable
for the customers to find out more about the place and book a stay, which leads to less effort
and errors for the restaurant management. _Until the late 1990s, all reservations were taken
over the phone and manually recorded in a reservation log. Guests dealt with busy signals,
double-booked tables, and transcription errors. In spite of these issues, some restaurants
still do it this way._ (Smaddalena, 2024).

For restaurants, the inefficiencies in reservation management can lead to lost revenue and
decreased customer satisfaction. During peak hours, traditional reservation methods may
result in long wait times for walk-in customers or overbooking, causing chaos and frustration
for both staff and patrons. Additionally, without a centralized and efficient system,
restaurants may struggle to gather and utilize valuable customer data for personalized
experiences and targeted marketing efforts (Harrison & Smith, 2020).

There are still many restaurants in Denmark that do not use a booking system at all, they
mostly rely on the reservations taken manually over the phone. This gives many limitations
to the customers, as it is not the most efficient way to reserve a place. Lack of real-time
availability or booking for days ahead can bring many challenges for both clients and
restaurant management (Plazn, 2023). This also includes more waiting time, and difficulty in
finding available slots, and in the end, it could end up messing up the appointments. As of
today, several websites are used across the world to book a table such as _OpenTable_ or
_Dinnerbooking_. For example, OpenTable, a popular reservation platform, lists only around
13 restaurants in Denmark, suggesting that many venues in the country may not utilize such
services (opentable, 2024). In Denmark, the most used are _earlybird_ and
_easyTableBooking_.

The existing solutions in the market, such as standalone restaurant reservation platforms or
review websites, fail to address these challenges comprehensively. They often lack
integration, personalization, and real-time capabilities, leaving room for improvement in
enhancing the dining experience (Anderson & Brown, 2019). The problem with these
solutions is that they only offer a limited number of restaurants, the most probable cause
could be the cost of such big systems to use. For cafes and smaller restaurants, the high
cost is a dealbreaker which is why many prefer to use the old ways.
By improving the reservation system, restaurants can get more customers and be more
efficient. It's important to use digital solutions to meet modern customer demands and
provide a seamless dining experience.

## System Architecture

![Architecture Image](/images/projectImages/ArchitectureImage.png)

Displays the system architecture. The System architecture is design with having **React.js** as frontend framework using **Typescript** and **.NET C#** as the backend for the system.Both frontend and backend are wrapped into the container using **Docker**. The **React.js** frontend is used as the user interface for the system and communicates with the backend through a **REST API**.Backend uses **CLEAN** architecture and it handles all the business logic and operations necessary for the system. **Docker** files are inside of both frontend and backend and are used to form the application into the container ready for deployment.

The backend interacts with multiple outside services to provide extra functionality for the system.There are different external services that backend is managing , for image storage for what is utilised Azure Blob Storage to safely and securely store images.For the location functionality is utilises **MapBox Location API** to fetch requested information regarding mapping. For the data storage database **Azure SQL Database** is used to store the data and manage it in a safe manner.Also **MailTrap** email service is used to handle email for sending notifications about reservation.

To automate the process for deployment , the project is integrated with **GitHub Actions** that is automating the **CI/CD** workflow of the system. Whenever a push or pull request is made to the main branch in the **GitHub** repository , the pipeline is triggered , triggering the workflow. The workflow starts by Logging in to **Azure** with required credentials that are safely stored at **GitHub Secrets**. After all the authentication is finished with Azure credentials it proceeds to build the Docker images for both of the images , so for backend and frontend, it reads it from the GitHub repository finding its location.One the images are build they are pushed to the **Azure Container Registry** where they are stored for deployment.

Next, pipeline is performing the final step that is deployment by pushing the docker images to the **Azure Web Apps**. The deployment process creates two separate web applications each of them hosting **docker images** , one for backend and one for frontend.

The whole process of the Continuous Integration **(CI)** and Continuous Deployment **(CD)** is automated , reducing manual work and ensuring less error will be made by developers and providing more consistency.

## CLEAN Architecture

![Backend Image](/images/projectImages/BackendArchitecture.png)

Displays the design of the backend system.The system follows the clear separation of responsibilities.The **WebAPI** layer serves as entry point , where in this example ReservationController handle API requests and it will interact with the **Application** Layer, the IReservationsLogic interface is implemented by ReservationLogic class, which contains the logic for handling reservations. This layer also handles and interacts with the Services, such as ReservationEmailService and EmailService, for handling email notification.

The system follows key principles of **SOLID** , such as Single Responsibility , Interface Segregation and Liskov Substitution. Single Responsibility Principle was followed by having each of the classes to be responsible for a specific part of the functionality. Interface Segregation principle was followed by having defined only required methods in the interfaces , avoiding having big bloated interfaces. Liskov Substitution Principle was followed to ensure that for example derived classes , such as ReservationLogic can replace the IReservationLogic without changing behavior expected by the rest of the system.

The Application layer depends on the **EfcDataAccess** layer, where the ReservationsEfcDao interacts with the database through the ReservationContext.This makes sure that data is retrieved and persisted , which is following the Dependency Rule , relying on abstractions like IReservationsDao.Also the backend uses Domain entities such as Reservation and its data access objects such as ReservationDto and ReservationNotificationDto, which is core data structure and its also reused across the layers.

By applying the **Clean** Architecture to the backend, it ensures that the key principles are applied.This approach allows the logic to be independent of the external services such as databases or user interface frameworks, also it makes it easier to integrate additional functionality which improves the maintainability of the codebase.

## UI Design

![UI image](/images/UI-image.png)
![UI image 2](/images/UI-image2.png)
![UI image 3](/images/UI-image3.png)

## Authentication - Frontend

![ Implementation image ](/images/I-Image.png)

Shows an Auth useState hook initialises the auth state by taking the **JWT token** from localStorage. setAuth function checks if the user is authenticated by checking if the token exists and if it exists then the user is authenticated and role and id are extracted from the token and set for the user useState. If the auth is false then it will clear the user useState , remove the token from the localStorage and reset the authentication.

## Authentication - Backend

![ Implementation image 2 ](/images/I-Image2.png)

Explains the process of Login in the **logic** layer.
Starting off with the LogicUser method that is validating the user and if the user exists gives it to the GenerateJwt method.
The GenerateJwt method is called to create a list of claims that represent the user's data.SymmetricSecurityKey is a key that is created using \_jwtKey that is taken from the environment variable.The key is used to sign **JWT** using an algorithm which will ensure the authenticity of the token.JwtHeader contains the signing credentials , specification of the algorithm that is used. Payload contains claims, and additional data. A JwtSecurityToken object is called that will take in the Header and Payload.Then the token is being serialised into the string format using the JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken which returns the final **JWT** token.GenerateClaims method generates the claims about the user and some additional data and returns it as a list.

## Update reservation - Frontend

![ Implementation image 3](/images/IImage3.png)
![ Implementation image 4](/images/IImage4.png)

Shows an updateDialog component that provides a user interface for updating reservation details. It utilizes useState to manage the input from the form, and when submitted it calls this handleUpdate function which makes a reservation object that is sent to backend through onUpdateSuccess function , if successful then calls the API , otherwise it will display an error.

## Project future

The project is missing five planned requirements , so the next logical step would be to implement those missing ones.Also new features could be added if in the future there are customers that require certain requirements , perhaps quality of life changes.
Regarding the frontend , the group could've made custom user interface design with good responsiveness for different screens with figma , also server side rendering could be added using technology such as Next.js.Also frontend deployed application that should not have any console.log due to security risks.
When it comes to the backend , a lot of optimisation could've been done in the database such as making better LINQ in order to have faster time or retrieving data. Adhere to all of the SOLID principles.
Moving on to the Azure , more things could've been utilized such as their email service or their azure maps api, the deployment of the entire system should been done once for the development in order to test new features with a test database , and one should be deployment for the production when all the features are working as intended.
Addressing the remaining requirements and exploring additional ones would enhance project usability and functionality. Further optimisation in design , implementation and deployment process could improve performance and also security.
