## Idea

We came up with the idea of converting CS 1.6 into a VR game. CS 1.6 isnâ€™t easy to recreate in VR under time constraints, so we targeted a focused demo:

- Offline
- One map: **Dust2**
- One gun: **AK-47**
- Movement mechanics: **jump**, **shift/sprint**, **crouch**
- Assets gathered from the internet (e.g., walking/kill-streak/gun sounds) and a community Dust2 map

## Assets

We used original-style textures, sounds, and models. The original game uses specific file extensions, so we sourced **de_dust2** online in `.obj` with textures, extracted sounds from the game files, and converted the gun model from `.mdl` to `.fbx` via a Blender plugin.

## Implementation

Currently, the Dust2 map is integrated with the AK-47. You can move around the map. We also modeled the AK-47 with a detachable magazine in Blender.

## Requirements

- Move around **de_dust2**
- **Shooting mechanic**
  - Holding a gun in the hand
  - Fire a bullet
  - Reload
  - Recoil
  - Charging handle
- Throwing a **HE grenade**
- **Sound effects**
- **Extra features**
  - Particle effects
  - Physical objects that respond to grenade explosions and being shot
  - AI bots
  - Health
  - Damage
  - Ammo
